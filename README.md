> A simple and fast package manager for the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). üê†

This is an *WIP* Git-based *"package manager"* for Fish shell which is under **active** development.

**Note:** Some features are missing right now but it covers the most of functionalities needed to be usable. However feel free to contribute. See [TODO](#todo) list.

## Features

- Rely only on [Git](https://git-scm.com/) binary and its well known features (clone, fetch, checkout, pull, tag, etc).
- No registries. Git repositories instead.
- Just uses the format: `username/package_name@(tag_name|branch_name)`.
- Install, update or remove packages from local repositories or remote ones.
- Tiny but ultra fast static binary powered by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Package file support ([`paket.toml`](#package-file)) to describe a package and copy optional non `.fish` files.
- Trigger [Fish shell events](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/emit.html) when a package is installed, updated or uninstalled.
- It runs only on top of a Fish shell session (Fish parent process).
- First class Docker support.

## Download/Install

- Docker image using latest Alpine ‚Üí [hub.docker.com/r/joseluisq/paket](https://hub.docker.com/r/joseluisq/paket)
- Release binaries for Linux/Macos amd64 ‚Üí [github.com/joseluisq/paket/releases](https://github.com/joseluisq/paket/releases)

### MacOS

Via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (also Linux)


```sh
brew tap joseluisq/paket

# Just the binary
brew install paket-bin

# Or build from source
brew install paket-src
```

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:

~> paket up joseluisq/gitnow@2.5.1
~> paket rm joseluisq/gitnow
```

#### Local packages

~> paket add ~/some-dir/my-pckage-dir
~> paket up ~/some-dir/my-pckage-dir
~> paket rm ~/some-dir/my-pckage-dir
```

## Paket file

Paket supports a `paket.toml` file in order to describe a package and copy optional non `.fish` files.
Here a sample file of [GitNow](https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow) Fish package.

```toml
[package]
name = "gitnow"
version = "2.5.1"
authors = ["Jose Quintana <https://joseluisq.net>"]
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
description = "Speed up your Git workflow. üê†"
repository = "https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow"
keywords = [
    "git",
    "git-workflow",
    "fish-shell",
    "fish-packages",
    "keybindings",
    "bitbucket",
    "github"
]

# Copy extra non Fish files (optional)
include = [
    "conf.d/.gitnow"
]

# Paket events which can trigger Fish shell events (optional)
# Use the format `[package_name]_[event_name]` without the brackets and spaces (underscores instead).
# Also make sure that every value match with your package's Fish shell event (--on-event).
[events]
after-install = "gitnow_install"
after-update = "gitnow_update"
before-uninstall = "gitnow_uninstall"

[dependencies]
```

## Fish shell events

Paket has few events which can be used to trigger [Fish shell events](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/emit.html) defined in your package.

- `after-install`: After a package is installed.
- `after-update`: After a package is updated.
- `before-uninstall`: Before a package is uninstalled.

### Events definition and format

Appending a `-e` or `--on-event` flag to your function(s) tells Fish to run it when the specified named event is emitted.

Use the format `[package_name]_[event_name]` without the brackets and spaces (underscores instead).
Also make sure that every value match with your package's Fish shell event (`--on-event`).

### Package example

Define a `paket.toml` file for your package:

```toml
[package]
name = "mypackage"
version = "0.0.0"
# ...

# Events (optional)
[events]
after-install = "mypackage_install"
before-uninstall = "mypackage_uninstall"
```

Optionally you can sign your corresponding functions with the `--on-event` (`-e`) value defined above.

```fish
# It will be immediately run after the package is installed
function __my_package_install -e mypackage_install
    echo "Installing my package..."
end

# It will be immediately run before the package is uninstalled
function __my_package_uninstall -e mypackage_uninstall
    echo "Uninstalling my package..."
end
```

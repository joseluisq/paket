# Paket üì¶

> A simple package manager for the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). üê†

This is an *WIP* Git-based *"package manager"* for Fish shell which is under **active** development.

## Features

- Rely only on [Git](https://git-scm.com/) binary and its well known features (clone, fetch, checkout, pull, tag, etc).
- No registries. Git repositories instead.
- Just uses the format: `username/package_name@(tag_name|branch_name)`
- Tiny but ultra fast static binary powered by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Package file support (`paket.toml`) to describe a package or copy non `.fish` files.

## Paket file

`paket.toml` sample file of [GitNow](https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow) Fish plugin.

```toml
[package]
name = "gitnow"
version = "2.5.1"
authors = ["Jose Quintana <git.io/joseluisq>"]
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
description = "Speed up your Git workflow. üê†"
repository = "https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow"
keywords = [
    "git",
    "git-workflow",
    "fish-shell",
    "fish-packages",
    "keybindings",
    "bitbucket",
    "github"
]

# Copy extra non Fish files
include = [
    "conf.d/.gitnow"
]

[dependencies]
```

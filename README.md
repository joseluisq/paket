# Paket üì¶

> A simple package manager for the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). üê†

This is an *WIP* Git-based *"package manager"* for Fish shell which is under **active** development.

## Features

- Rely only on [Git](https://git-scm.com/) binary and its well known features (clone, fetch, checkout, pull, tag, etc).
- No registries. Git repositories instead.
- Just uses the format: `username/package_name@(tag_name|branch_name)`
- Tiny but ultra fast static binary powered by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Package file support ([`paket.toml`](#package-file)) to describe a package and copy optional non `.fish` files.
- Trigger [Fish shell events](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/emit.html) when a package is installed, updated or uninstalled.

## Usage

```sh
~> paket --help
paket 0.0.0
A simple package manager for the Fish shell üì¶

USAGE:
    paket [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    add     Add a new package from a local or remote repository
    help    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    rm      Remove an existing package
    up      Update an existing package
```

#### Examples

```sh
~> paket add joseluisq/gitnow@2.4.0
~> paket up joseluisq/gitnow@2.5.1
~> paket rm joseluisq/gitnow
```

## Package file

Paket supports a `paket.toml` file in order to describe a package and copy optional non `.fish` files.
Here a sample file of [GitNow](https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow) Fish package.

```toml
[package]
name = "gitnow"
version = "2.5.1"
authors = ["Jose Quintana <git.io/joseluisq>"]
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
description = "Speed up your Git workflow. üê†"
repository = "https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow"
keywords = [
    "git",
    "git-workflow",
    "fish-shell",
    "fish-packages",
    "keybindings",
    "bitbucket",
    "github"
]

# Copy extra non Fish files
include = [
    "conf.d/.gitnow"
]

[dependencies]
```

## Fish shell events

Since Fish shell supports [events](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/emit.html), Paket will emit the following ones:

- `paket_install`: After a package gets installed.
- `paket_update`: After a package gets updated.
- `paket_uninstall`: After a package gets uninstalled.

### Events definition

Just appending a `-e` (`--on-event`) flag to your function(s) tells Fish to run it when the specified named event gets emitted.

Examples:

```fish
# It will be immediately run after the package is installed
function __my_package_install -e paket_install
    echo "Installing my package..."
end

# It will be immediately run after the package is uninstalled
function __my_package_uninstall -e paket_uninstall
    echo "Uninstalling my package..."
end
```
